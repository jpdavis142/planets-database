Venus is the hottest planet in the solar system, with an average surface temperature of about 465°C due to its thick heat-trapping atmosphere.

Venus rotates in the opposite direction of most planets, causing the Sun to rise in the west and set in the east.

A single day on Venus is longer than a year because it takes 243 Earth days to rotate once but only 225 days to orbit the Sun.
