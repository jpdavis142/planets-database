Mercury is the smallest planet in the solar system, with a diameter of about 4,880 km, making it only slightly larger than Earth’s Moon.

Mercury experiences extreme temperature changes, reaching about 430°C during the day and dropping to around –180°C at night due to its thin atmosphere.

Mercury has the shortest year of any planet, completing one orbit around the Sun in just 88 Earth days.
