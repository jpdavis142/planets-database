This is my planets database.

## Brief Description
Mercury and Venus are the inner planets because they orbit close to the Sun and are made mainly of rock and metal, with Mercury being the smallest planet and having a crater-covered surface and extreme temperature changes due to its lack of atmosphere, while Venus is slightly smaller than Earth but is the hottest planet because its thick, toxic clouds trap heat and create crushing pressure, and in contrast Jupiter and Saturn are outer planets known as gas giants because they are made mostly of hydrogen and helium, with Jupiter being the largest planet and home to massive storms like the Great Red Spot, while Saturn is famous for its bright rings and large moon Titan, and together these planets show the dramatic differences between the small rocky inner planets and the huge, powerful outer ones.


### Fun Fact!
Did you know that om Saturn and Jupiter, it can literally rain diamonds? This is because intense pressure deep inside those planets can turn carbon into tiny diamond crystals.
