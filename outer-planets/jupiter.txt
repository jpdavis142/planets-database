Jupiter is the largest planet in the solar system and is more than twice as massive as all the other planets combined.

Jupiter’s Great Red Spot is a gigantic storm that has been raging for over 300 years.

Jupiter has the strongest gravity of any planet, allowing it to pull in many asteroids and comets.

Jupiter gives off more heat than it receives from the Sun, because it is still slowly shrinking and releasing leftover energy from when it first formed.
